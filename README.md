This python3 script performs A* search and planning algorithm on a 600x250 canvas with obstacles

The scripts includes following libraries:
-math\
-heapdict\
-numpy\
-vidmaker\
-sortedcollections\
-time\
-pygame

**To install heapDict():**
Run below command in the terminal:
-pip install HeapDict

**To install sortedcollections():**
Run below command in the terminal:
-pip install sortedcollections

**To install vidmaker():**
Run below command in the terminal:
-pip install vidmaker

To run the code, open any editor (preferably VSC) and run the script.

***Testing algorithm***
To test the A* algorithm.
1. Run the python script and provide obstacle buffer value (Example: 2)
2. Provide Robot size (Example: 2)
3. Provide initial x, y and theta values with spaces (Example: 10 95 5)
4. Provide goal x, y and theta values with spaces (Example: 170 220 90)
5. Provide step size between and including 1 and 10.
6. Search algorithm will provide a backtrack path along with time value it took to search the goal node.
7. The animation video of tracking will be generated and saved as an mp4 file.
